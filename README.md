## Free online service to evaluate Code Quality

Event: [Beyond Banking Days initiated by ABN AMRO](https://beyondbanking.nl)

When: 9, 10 and 11 June 2017

Venue: [Sugar City, Halfweg NL](https://blockchainhackathon.eu/events/hackathon-the-big-weekend)


## Why your code is evaluated.

It is amazing to see how far our industry has come over the past decades. New technologies, frameworks, agile processes - some of which were only recently invented - now define the way we work today. One prominently missing building block in the modern development setup is a standardised way to normatively measure code quality - a SMART 'Definition of Done' shared by all developers.

Based on 15+ years of research and tens of thousands of measurements on IT systems from numerous industries, SIG presents 'Better Code Hub’ (BCH), an online environment that allows anyone to measure how their code compares to 10 rules for future-proof code. These ten rules code are described in SIG's book 'Building Maintainable Software', which was published with O'Reilly Media and which will be handed out at the event.

## Your code is evaluated by using Better Code Hub (BCH).

1. Your code will be automatically evaluated and benchmarked against 10 guidelines for building future-proof code. Find a concise reference card of the guidelines [here](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*TS-ZTeI7sQS7dy_AlMqSXQ.png)

2. You can check your code against the guidelines using [Better Code Hub](https://github.com/integrations/better-code-hub), a [GitHub.com](https://Github.com) integration provided by [Software Improvement Group SIG](https://www.sig.eu). [Better Code Hub](https://bettercodehub.com) integrates with the GitHub Flow and can run in a CI/CD pipeline on all your Pull Requests and Commits.

3. 16 modern programming languages are [supported](https://bettercodehub.com/docs/configuration-manual) with a maximum of 200 KLoc per code base.

4. if you have multiple repos the lowest scoring repo is used for your final mark (weakest link principle).


## How this works.

1. Make sure that you are a member of https://github.com/orgs/BeyondBankingDays/. Slack/Talk to organization of Hackathon if you are not yet a member. Membership of BeyondBankingDays allows you to analyse your private repo's.

2. Go to [bettercodehub.com](https://bettercodehub.com) 

3. Press Play button get instant feedback on the 10 guidelines and pick refactor candidates

4. Enable Push and Pull Request support

5. Send your badge to be added to the scoreboard. [here](https://beyondbankingdays.github.io/scoreboard)


## How to get support.

1. Before the event, through bettercodehub@sig.eu

2. During the event on [Slack](https://beyondbankinghack.slack.com/) @zlubsen @ravish or @martinboerman with questions about Better Code Hub.

3. The guidelines are described in full in [“Building Maintainable Software”](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920049555.do) (get your free copy during the event)

4. After the event, through bettercodehub@sig.eu 

5. Your Pro access to Better Code Hub remains valid for *1 month* after the event


## How the scorebord works.

1. You get points based on your score in Better Code Hub. The more guidelines you get right, the higher the score. The maximum is 10 out of 10.

2. Your Better Code Hub Badge [![BCH compliance](https://bettercodehub.com/edge/badge/dbh17-abraxas/ShareEverythingWeb)](https://bettercodehub.com) and team name need to be on [this digital scoreboard](http://beyondbankingdays.github.io/scoreboard). Talk to us on Slack or send a PR with the code.
